# The Year (in review?)

2023 went by quickly, so quickly that I've forgotten about most of the cool stuff that I've done. My New Years' resolution is to start documenting the things I've learned and worked on. Hopefully, this will give me better insight into what I've been up to and help out others that might be struggling with the same problems.

My first entry will be about my Steam Deck.

# The Deck

Long story short, I got an OLED Steam Deck because I transit a lot and that's often when I have some time to unwind. Having this around means I can play all my games everywhere I go.

# The Problem

Everything was great until I plugged in my headphones and was greeted by this very loud noise. At first, I tried to ignore it, but it got too loud, so I switched to my AirPods.

It got annoying to pair them after a while. Plus, if nothing was happening on the Deck, the AirPods would occasionally disconnect and reconnect. That got annoying after a while, so I began to investigate how I could fix the noise.

I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuCFw-gfhlA) from [Tony Cassara](https://www.youtube.com/@TonyCassara) that detailed the same issue and a possible fix. Tony said that the fix didn't completely work for him, but I thought I would give it a shot anyway.

# The Attempt

I began by removing the eight screws on the back of my Deck. The headphone jack is located above the battery.

I noticed that parts of the area under the daughterboard were silver. This meant to me that it was possibly conductive, which was something to keep in mind for later.

Here is the result of the initial mod as suggested by {the YouTuber}. Notice how the tape on the top left is not aligned properly — I'll get to that later.

I also put some tape on the back. I wanted to isolate the ground points as much as I could.

# The Mistake

I didn't hear any noise after I performed the mod, but I realized that I forgot to take pictures for my writeup, so I disassembled the Deck again. When I reassembled the Deck, I heard a bit of noise again, so I inspected the tape. Turns out that some of the tape was warped and I had to reapply it. This is the reason behind why the tape in one of the earlier photos wasn't aligned: the screw caused it to warp.

# The Result

After doing that and reassembling everything, there was no noise at all and I was happy.
